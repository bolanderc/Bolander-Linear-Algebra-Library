# Math 5610 Computational Linear Algebra and Solution of Systems of Equations Software Manual
This is a part of the student software manual project for Math 5610: Computational Linear Algebra and Solution of Systems of Equations.

**Module Name:**           mach_prec

**Author:** Christian Bolander

**Language:** Python. This code was written in Python 3.

**Description/Purpose:** This module allows for the calculation of machine epsilon on the computer on which it is implemented. Both single and double precision values are included.

**Routine Listings:**
-----------------
- [smaceps()](smaceps.md)    Calculates and returns machine epsilon in single precision.
- [dmaceps()](dmaceps.md)    Calculates and returns machine epsilon in double precision.
