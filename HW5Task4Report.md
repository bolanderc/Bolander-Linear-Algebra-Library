# Homework 5 Task 4: Large SPD Matrix Example

*Task: Write a code that will generate a symmetric, positive definite matrix for a given integer, n. Make sure that you add an entry to your software manual with a couple of examples. Your examples should be relatively small for your examples, but you should include a large example in the task solution write-up.*

Using a 30 x 30 matrix in the [spd_mat_gen](./Software_Manual/spd_mat_gen.md) subroutine yields the matrix shown [here](./large_spd.txt).
